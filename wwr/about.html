                            <p> Exciting Expeditions began not as a company, but as a
                                passion project. In the summer of 1972, two college friends
                                and avid kayakers, Mark and Jenna, found themselves guiding
                                their less-experienced friends down the local river on large,
                                inflatable military surplus rafts. They saw the sheer joy and
                                awe on their friends' faces and recognized an opportunity.

                            <p>The following year, they officially founded "White Water Rafting Company,"
                                operating out of a converted garage with a single raft,
                                a beat-up pickup truck, and a hand-painted sign by the river's
                                main access point. Their business model was simple: a small
                                fee for a wild ride and a promise of safety. Word quickly spread about
                                the thrilling adventures offered by Mark and Jenna.
                                By their third season, they had expanded to three rafts and hired two additional guides.
