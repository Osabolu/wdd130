            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Exciting Expeditions began not as a company, but as a
            passion project. In the summer of 1972, two college friends
            and avid kayakers, Mark and Jenna, found themselves guiding
            their less-experienced friends down the local river on large,
            inflatable military surplus rafts. They saw the sheer joy and
            awe on their friends' faces and recognized an opportunity.
            The following year, they officially founded "White Water Rafting Company,"
            operating out of a converted garage with a single raft,
            a beat-up pickup truck, and a hand-painted sign by the river's
            main access point. Their business model was simple: a small
            fee for a wild ride and a promise of safety.
