            <p>Zuma Rock is a prominent natural granite monolith located in Niger State, Nigeria, near the capital city of Abuja, and is famously depicted on the country's 100 naira banknote. Rising from the flat plains along the main road from Abuja to Kaduna, it is a significant landmark, sometimes referred to as the "Gateway to Abuja" due to its commanding presence.</p>
