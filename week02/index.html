            <p>Hi! I am Emmanuel Okpere, and  I'm from Nigeria. When I'm not working,<br>
            I like to cook and try out various cooking recipes. I am currently studying<br>
            Software development at BYU-Idaho. I am super excited to learn more<br>about
            software development and trends.

                Zuma Rock is a prominent natural granite monolith (an inselberg) located in Niger State,
                Nigeria, near the capital city of Abuja, and is famously depicted on the country's 100
                naira banknote. Rising from the flat plains along the main road from Abuja to Kaduna,
                it is a significant landmark, sometimes referred to as the "Gateway to Abuja" due to its
                commanding presence. The rock is an igneous intrusion composed of gabbro and granodiorite
                and is rich in cultural and spiritual significance, featuring in many local myths and stories.
